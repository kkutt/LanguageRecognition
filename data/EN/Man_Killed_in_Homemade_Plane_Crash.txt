A 65-year-old man was killed and his daughter seriously injured after the home-built plane they were flying in crashed at a Colorado airport on Tuesday.
Richard M. "Rick" Tackabury was flying a twin-engine Air Cam experimental kit plane that he had built himself when the crash occurred. He was attempting to land on a grass runway at Colorado's Fort Morgan Airport but collided with the ground between the grass and concrete runways after the plane rose unexpectedly midway through the landing.
Morgan County Sheriff Jim Crone told ABC's Denver Affiliate KMGH that Rick Tackabury was killed instantly in the crash. His daughter, 42-year-old Laura Jean Tackabury was airlifted to North Colorado Medical Center.
Crone also told KMGH that it was Tackabury's third time flying the open cockpit aircraft, a cross between an ultra-light and a standard small plane. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
